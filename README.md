# Idea Pool

Short on ideas for a project or to work through a new concept? Take a dip in the **Idea Pool**!  

It can be difficult to know where to start when faced with a "blank page" problem - how do you begin to choose what you will do! **Idea Pool** addresses this issue by pooling ideas and projects from application users together into one source.

You can choose to share any ideas you add, or not - it's up to you! You can view projects built from yours or others ideas, and gain inspiration you need to just start coding something.
